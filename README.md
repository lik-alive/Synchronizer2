# Synchronizer v2

## Info

**Analyze and synchronize folders (Windows)**

This is a deep reinvention of the previous Synchronizer based on the most common use cases.

A software for convenient synchronization of Windows folders. It provides a clear and simple tree-like interface for comparing files in two folders by `length` and `date modified`. Instead of multithreading and synchronization workspaces, there are extremely fast, reliable and handy tools. 

The Synchronizer is distributed as a single exe file (see the Release section).
